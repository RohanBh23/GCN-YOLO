# GCN-YOLO

- **Object Detection with YOLO**: YOLO is a popular real-time object detection algorithm that divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell.
- **Limitation**: YOLO may struggle with accurately detecting objects in complex scenes where spatial relationships between objects are crucial for detection.
- **Objective**: Enhance YOLO's performance by incorporating spatial relationships using Graph Convolutional Network layers.The integrated YOLO-GCN model enhances object detection accuracy by capturing spatial relationships between objects, leading to improved performance in complex scenes.

### Graph Representation:
- **Constructing Graphs**: Representation of the image as a graph, where nodes represent objects and edges represent spatial relationships (e.g., distance, orientation) between objects.
- **Node Features**: Each node (object) is associated with features such as bounding box coordinates, class probabilities, and visual features (extracted using CNNs).
- **Edge Features**: Define edge features based on spatial relationships between objects (e.g., distance between bounding boxes, relative orientations).

### Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs):
- **GCN Layers**: Utilize GCN layers to aggregate information from neighboring nodes in the graph, enabling information exchange between objects.
- **Node Update Function**: Define a node update function that aggregates information from neighboring nodes and updates node features accordingly.
- **Graph Pooling**: Optionally, incorporate graph pooling layers to dynamically aggregate information at different scales of the graph.

### Model Integration:
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Integrate GCN layers into the YOLO architecture, either by extending the YOLO backbone or by adding GCN layers on top of the YOLO feature maps.
- **End-to-End Training**: Train the integrated model end-to-end, optimizing both YOLO-specific objectives (e.g., bounding box regression, object classification) and GCN-specific objectives (e.g., node feature aggregation).

### Evaluation Metrics:
- **Object Detection Accuracy**: Evaluate the improved YOLO model using standard metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), which measures the precision-recall trade-off for object detection.
- **Spatial Relationship Accuracy**: Introduce new metrics to evaluate the model's ability to capture spatial relationships between objects, such as mean IoU (Intersection over Union) between predicted object clusters and ground truth clusters.

### Experimental Validation:
- **Datasets**: Conduct experiments on benchmark object detection datasets; COCO and Pascal VOC with diverse scenes and object categories.
- **Baseline Comparison**: Comparision of the performance of the enhanced YOLO model with traditional YOLO models and other state-of-the-art object detection methods.
- **Ablation Studies**: Performed ablation studies to analyze the contribution of GCN layers and different design choices (e.g., graph construction methods, GCN architectures) to the overall performance.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Graph Representation:
- **Node Features**: Let $\( x_i \)$ denote the feature vector associated with node $\( i \)$, representing an object detected by YOLO. This feature vector includes bounding box coordinates, class probabilities, and visual features extracted using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- **Edge Features**: Define edge features $\( e_{ij} \)$ between nodes $\( i \)$ and $\( j \)$ based on spatial relationships such as the distance between bounding boxes, relative orientations, and overlap between objects.

### 2. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs):
- **Node Update Function**: The node update function aggregates information from neighboring nodes and updates node features. Let $\( h_i^l \)$ denote the node feature vector at layer $\( l \)$, the node update function can be formulated as:
$\[ h_i^{l+1} = \sigma \left( \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \frac{1}{c_{ij}} W^{(l)} h_j^l + b^{(l)} \right) \]$
where $\( \mathcal{N}(i) \)$ represents the neighbors of node $\( i \)$, $\( W^{(l)} \)$ and $\( b^{(l)} \)$ are learnable parameters of the GCN layer, $\( c_{ij} \)$ is a normalization factor, and $\( \sigma \)$ is the activation function.

### 3. Object Detection Integration:
- **Feature Fusion**: Integrate GCN layers into the YOLO architecture by fusing GCN-processed features with traditional YOLO feature maps.
- **GCN Output**: The output of the GCN layers, denoted as $\( H \)$, is concatenated with the YOLO feature maps, and further processed to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell.

### 4. Loss Function:
- **Objective Function**: The loss function for the integrated YOLO-GCN model combines YOLO-specific objectives (e.g., bounding box regression, object classification) and GCN-specific objectives (e.g., node feature aggregation). Let $\( L_{YOLO} \)$ denote the YOLO loss and $\( L_{GCN} \)$ denote the GCN loss, the overall loss function can be defined as:
$\[ L_{total} = \lambda L_{YOLO} + (1 - \lambda) L_{GCN} \]$
where $\( \lambda \)$ is a hyperparameter controlling the trade-off between YOLO and GCN objectives.

### 5. Training:
- **End-to-End Training**: Training of the integrated YOLO-GCN model end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or other optimization techniques. Updating the parameters of both YOLO and GCN components simultaneously to minimize the total $loss \( L_{total} \)$.
